        <h2> Biography </h2>
    
            <p> Hey there! My name is Marcela and I'm a seventeen year old with a passion for Computer Science. Honduran born and raised, I moved to New York City 1 month shy of my fifteenth birthday, and was later enrolled at George Westinghouse High School and placed in the school's multimedia program, where my love for coding started. </p>
            <p> I enjoy making small webpages from scratch, playing around with Javascript, and always taking my code an extra mile. </p>
        
        <h2> Credits </h2>
          
             <p> I would like to thank my ScriptEd manager, Alyxe Lett, as well my mentors Meghan Knoll, Jesse Wang, Mat Brown, and Alex Pelan for teaching me everything I know about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as always pushing me to do my best and provide me with amazing opportunities and experiences.  </p>
